Hello everyone, today we are rolling out TJC Dashboards!

TJC Dashboards can be found at the url "tinyurl.com/TJCDashB".
It is a site at which TJC Students can have a convenient place to store and access HBL related links and reference a live timetime. 
To get a better idea of the various features available and how to use them, we have included a video that showcases the main features :)

Summary of Key Features
1. General Links to HBL Related Sites (Standard across all classes)
2. Class Links to HBL Related Sites (Updated by CG Reps)
3. Personal Links (Updated by Students)
4. Real-Time Timetable (with red visual indicator present during weekdays during school time)
5. Virtual Bell (an audio cue that rings every 25 mins, aligned with the periods during lesson)
6. Class Notepad (a place for nice messages and homework reminders)

Note:
- The site looks terrible on mobile and has not been optimized for that so try to use a computer to access it.


For the CG Reps, you have 3 tasks to do
1. Inform your class about the existance of TJC Dashboards
-- a. Feel free to forward the above message to your class group chat

2. Update the class custom links
-- a. Go onto your dashboard (the index number does not matter for this) and click on the "update class links" button at the bottom of the page.
-- b. Fill in the relevant class links as well as your class password (which will be distributed as well).
-- c. Click on the submit button.

3. Distribute Individual Passwords
-- a. A text file with format <class>.txt will be given out containing passwords.
-- b. The first line of <class>.txt is the class password used to change class links (CG Reps should hold onto that).
-- c. The next 30 lines are individual passwords used for students to change their personal custom links.
-- d. The individual passwords are based on index numbers, please relay each password to their specific user.
